*Unheralded: where I wax lyrical about music that you probably haven't heard before*

<!--more-->

Another Unheralded post, [another rockin' guitar riff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wK7k19Xxpo). The more I do of these posts, the more heavy riffs I will cover :)

It's awesome, ok? Like, super awesome. It's headbangingly good. It's a quick shotgun blast to the face of overdriven guitar riffing and thumping drums. It's like driving at full pelt through an old, dangerous Grand Prix track (think [Zandvoort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzEa47GsA24)), knocking you sideways with nasty speed changes and weird cambering.

And then it's over. Because the Fucking Champs never overstay their welcome. Like this post.
