The devops tooling landscape is wide and complex, with many offerings having differing and overlapping functionality. As such, it can be difficult to determine exactly how useful each is to you for your use case. Highly generic terms are scattered around the websites for these tools:
* Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS),
* Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS),
* provisioning,
* automation,
* scaling,
* deployments,
* jobs,
* configuration management,
* Infrastructure-as-Code,
* lifecycle management,
* scaling (did I say this already?),
* continuous

Here are just a taste of the devops tools out there:
* Concourse
* CircleCI
* TravisCI
* Jenkins
* Ansible
* Chef
* Puppet
* Terraform
*
