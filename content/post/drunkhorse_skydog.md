*Unheralded: where I wax lyrical about music that you probably haven't heard before*

<!--more-->

Do you like a quality rock guitar riff? What about another rock riff on keyboard? What about both of them together at the same time? This is Drunk Horse's Skydog.

At it's core, it's an extended jam session. Drums driving consistently throughout, bass offering solid support to the guitar lead and the keyboards creating this mellow, swirling vibe at the top of the mix. Technically, it's beautifully done. There are no vocals, which I think would mess with the song anyway. Without vocals, the song becomes whatever you feel.

For me, it inspires chills. I'm a sucker for two guitar leads รก la Thin Lizzy and this has a fantastic variation on that (as do a number of their other songs on the In Tongues album). What this song has above all is the fun factor. Rock should be fun, and too many bands miss this essential truth. It's entertainment, goddamit! Leave the heart-wrenching stuff to the nancy boys who wail about how their girl doesn't like them any more. So yes, this song is **FUN** and **it rocks**.

Tough to find an easily available version online, you can listen [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1Asxoo4aW3jAFiiNoQC41G) along with the rest of the rockin' and rollin' album.
