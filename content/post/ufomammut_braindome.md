*Unheralded: where I wax lyrical about music that you probably haven't heard before*

The oppressive atmosphere starts early: a grim excerpt, an interview with somebody describing a nuclear explosion. Usually a hackneyed technique, it works really well for [Ufomammut's Braindome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUGq_MabZa0).

The highlights are many: the pounding, driving hammer to the head that are the drums, a tearing guitar that's fuzzified to the max, and the evocative atmosphere that permeates through every note of the song.

I'll never warm to the unintelligible cookie-monster screaming that is such a staple of metal and makes it's appearance here. Then again, the lyrics, such as they are, are very low down in the mix so it never annoys me the way it would on other metal tracks.

What I look for from any music I listen to is heart, emotion and intent.  The song fulfills these criteria superbly. The intent of Braindome is to inspire darkness, despair and, above all, fear. Also, headbanging :)

Both this and the album Snailking are definite recommendations from me. [Check it out](https://ufomammut.bandcamp.com/album/snailking).
