Oof, it's been a while. I've been avoiding blogging for a while. It was lots of effort and I had other priorities. This time it will be different.

<!--more-->
I will have the following strategy:

* Make the posts small - less than 200 words for most, less than 600 in extreme cases
* Don't worry about inaccuracies
* Post often about anything that takes my fancy

I'm also using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) so no trying to build my own blog platform (so 2010).

Let's see how it goes!
